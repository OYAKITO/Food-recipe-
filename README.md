we noticed that github messes up the folder system and that you have to put out the demo and venv folders in order for the file to run properly on other pc, since the terminal shows that it cannot find the file if you dont do so.
Download the Zip
Extract the folder inside the zip named "Mamamo"

Open the folder you will notice another folder "Mamamo" and my README.md

inside the folder Mamamo you will find the folder "papamo"

Cut the folder and paste it on "Mamamo" directory alongside Mamamo folder

Open the project "Mamamo" in your preferred IDE 

Open your terminal 

input "cd papamo" and enter

input "python -m venv venv" and enter

input "venv\Script\activate" and enter

input "pip install django" and enter

input "python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip" and enter

input "python.exe manage.py runserver"

click and open "127.0.0.1:8000" link in the terminal

The website will now be opened on your main browser
